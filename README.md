## Overview
Elemental Tetris

Tetris with elemental reactions between pieces. Every time a piece is placed it will react with the piece closest to it, based on its element. The game will have two modes, with one being normal tetris, which is a game where there are several types of tetrominoes and they have to be stacked in a certain order such that once a row is fully complete, it clears itself from the board. The more rows that are cleared, the higher your score will be, and if the pieces stack up beyond the top of the board, you lose.

Elemental Reactions:

Fire + Water → evaporation

Fire + Wind → smokescreen: blurry vision/red blur

Fire + Lightning → explosion: removes 3x3 area*

Fire + Earth → lava: burns a 2-3 block deep hole from where the lava is created)*

Water + Wind → tsunami: turn all blocks into water blocks

Water + Lightning → electrocharged - removes random top blocks, bouncing between blocks

Water + Earth → ocean: turn all blocks blue (cosmetic) idk bruh

Wind + Lightning → thunderstorm: lightning blocks fall from sky

Wind + Earth → hurricane: shuffles board columns

Lightning + Earth → full clear board (this might be too op)
