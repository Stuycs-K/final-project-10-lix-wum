## Overview
Elemental Tetris

Tetris with elemental reactions between pieces. Every time a row is cleared the piece that is placed will react with the piece closest to it, based on its element. The game will have two modes, with one being normal tetris. In tetris, there are several types of tetrominoes and they have to be stacked in a certain order such that once a row is fully complete, it clears itself from the board. The more rows that are cleared, the higher your score will be, and if the pieces stack up beyond the top of the board, you lose. In elemental tetris, the concept is the same but with several interesting reactions that make the game more unpredictable.

Elemental Reactions:

Fire + Water → evaporation, removes top block of each column

Fire + Wind → smokescreen: blurry vision, goes away when you get another image reaction

Fire + Lightning → explosion: removes 3x3 area in the middle of the screen

Fire + Earth → lava: burns a hole down to the bottom of the board at a random column

Water + Wind → tsunami: turn all blocks into water blocks

Water + Lightning → electrocharged - removes random top blocks, bouncing between blocks

Water + Earth → mud: turns top layer into earth

Wind + Lightning → thunderstorm: all blocks turn into lightning

Wind + Earth → hurricane: shuffles board columns

Lightning + Earth → full clear board (very overpowered)


## Instructions
Controls (these can be changed using the config settings):

Arrow keys - move the tetromino left, right, and down

Z and X keys - rotate pieces counter-clockwise and clockwise

Space key - fast drop a piece to the bottom

C key - hold a piece and swap from the hold to the current piece

P key - pause the game (the config menu can be accessed from here)

Block Reactions - change this to true to make elemental reactions occur whenever a piece is placed, not just when a row is cleared
